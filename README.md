# Custom Mainsail Configuration

This is my custom Mainsail/Klipper config. It is based on the [RatOS config],
and tweaked for my own purposes based on work by [mainsail-crew], [mjonuschat],
[th33xitus][kiauh] and more, along with some of my own.

## Usage

This repo assumes an installation of [MainsailOS] via the Raspbarry Pi Imager, and
may require adjustments if another setup is used. You'll first clone the repo
and run the install script:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/gethe/mainsail_config.git
    sudo -u pi bash ~/mainsail_config/scripts/install.sh

This will create read-only symlink files in `/home/pi/printer_data/config` that
provide a basic config. It will also create moonraker.conf and printer.cfg files
that can be edited to override settings.

Additionally, the install script will install [linear_movement_analysis] and
[mainsail_theme] as well as run [kiauh].

## Note

This config is tailored to my own printers and the specific idiosyncrasies and
mods they have. As such, it may not work well for other printers without
significant changes.
